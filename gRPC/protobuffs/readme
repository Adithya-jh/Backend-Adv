This gRPC proto is mainly used for data compression.
protobufjs library is used to encode the data.

based on the structure in the a.proto file. the data has to be formatted. such that it will encode it correctly.
once we run the file a compressed version of data is created in another file.

If we store that data in json and we send data in json for large scale applications -> the size of the data is very much bigger.
the compressed data is 10X lesser in size than the json. It improves the bandwidth latency. Pbf is also very easy to parse tahn json.
