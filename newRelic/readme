APM : APPLICATION PERFORMANCE MONITORING -

Newrelic also lets you see all the logs and stats from your process, not just the host machine

create a new node application to monitor the process:

install dependencies -
npm install newrelic express

on config, newrelic gives a code to run :
NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=test NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=license_key node -r newrelic index.js"

run it and test the load.

the script is updated, to run the code, run
npm run start

LOGGING IN NEWRELIC:

We cant console log and expect newrelic to log, it does not work. so we have to use external logging library like winston to log the req.

Try enabling the `NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_FORWARDING_ENABLED` flag

in pacakage.json:
"start": "NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_FORWARDING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=test NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=your_key node -r newrelic index.js"

in here, instaed of console.log to do logger.info() , logger.log() , logger.warning() , logger.error() â†’ we are being bit more specific.
