NOW GETTING ONE LEVEL UP → WE ARE GONNA TEST ON HTTP REQUESTS.

THE LIB WE USE IS ‘SUPERTEST’.
how to test it?

The ideal way to test it is using a libary, which gets the logic out of the server and tests that code.

onesuch library is supertest.

supertests helps us to test http requests instead of writing the whole code for calling the api through fetch and axios and testing the results.

we import the “request” from “supertest”

this request will simulate a http request.
