First run the Backend server,
then go to post man, hit the http://localhost:3000/generate-otp endpoint,
A OTP will be generated in u r console.

Now we have to match that OTP with the OTP that we have generated in the console.


For that run the attack folder, it will hit the http://localhost:3000/reset-otp endpoint in the for loop in batches.
